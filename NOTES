Access control:

    Use tcp_wrappers during "MAIL FROM:" phase.  This allows SMTP-SASL
    to by-pass tcp_wrappers.  By having a command-line option to
    disable "open relay" checks, we can have the function that
    smtp.itd.umich.edu currently has: on campus clients can send mail
    anywhere, off-campus clients need to authenticate.  (This doesn't
    give the "off-campus clients can send mail to campus".)

    We also need the equivalent of "DeniedFrom" so that admins can
    break loops without denying connections from whole domains.

Queuing:

    We attempt to deliever newly received mail immediately.  If we
    successfully deliver mail for a host, we check for a queue for the
    host, and become a queue runner for that host.  This reduces admin
    intervention required to recover from a large queue.  (Some limit
    is probably necessary.)

    To allow parallel processing of queues, a queue runner first
    attempts a connection.  If connection succeeds, the top message is
    de-queued.  If delivery temp-fails, the message is re-queued to the
    bottom of the queue.  (This doesn't prevent many connection attempts
    when there are few messages queued.)

    We need to be careful not to "lose" queued messages.

    On startup, we could remove all queues and rebuild them from the
    spool files.  The main process can (probably) continue to run
    during this process.  It may be possible to scan continuously, but
    we want to avoid unnecessary locks.

Bounce:

    As the delivery proceeds, a transcript is kept of "critical"
    errors.  At the end of the delivery process, the transcript is
    converted into a DSN and added to the end of the envelope list, to
    be delivered as normal mail.
