.SH DESCRIPTION

.B simsendmail
is 
.B simta's
.B sendmail
interface

.B simsendmail
is
.B simta's
.B sendmail interface.  simsendmail is intended as a replacement for sendmail
in that any program that currently uses sendmail for communication
may use simsendmail instead.  simsendmail's behavior, including
command line options, should be identical to sendmail.

With no flags, simsendmail reads standard input until it reaches
either the end of file or a special marker consisting only of a
single dot on a line.  The single dot may be ignored as an end of
file marker with the -i option.   simsendmail then sends a copy of
the message found there to all of the to-addresses listed.
