BUGS
x   1 ignore ipv6
    3 simsendmail overrun bug
    3 group errors-to rewrite bug
    3 better localhost check for punt and jail hostnames
    4 better error messages when -requests/-errors/etc. are undeliverable

FEATURES
gateway enhancements
    2 mail_from check vs domains we have R rules
x   2 simta.conf & ldap include files (1 week)
x   2 RE module for cyrus lookups (mail.umich.edu)
x   2 per domain RBLs, potentially other config options as well
x   3 mutiple content filters: mail_from/rcpt_to/data/post-expansion
    3 umich-only: requires user_rbl + accept + configurable attribute
    4 LDAP exclusive moderated groups - ignore non-moderators, for lists

delivery optimization
    3 envelope splitting
    3 deliver in parallel to multiple mx records
    3 better interleave delivery/disk reads
    3 delivery agent can be called with multiple recipients (LMTP)
    3 expander only thread

general architecture
x   1 single master queue runner/smtp listener process
x   1 deliver local mail with no running simta daemon (sendmail replacement)
    1 smtp listen should occur after disk read during startup
x   2 relay host
    2 option to fork child for outbound delivery during inbound smtp
    2 R rules for accept AND exclusion
    2 shorten RBL timeouts?
    2 add option to skip rcpt to syntax check
    2 smtp timer for outbound DATA
    3 child killing (simc)
    3 queue processing by id (simc)
x   3 alias upgrade: wildcards, /dev/null, pipe2program discussion
    3 simexpander take addresses on stdin
    4 config file support for queue launch times
    4 interface listening choices
    4 expansion limits (configurable)
    4 strict moderator address matching?
    4 variable SMTP stage timeouts

support
    2 SIGHUP to re-read conf file (e.g. to change max connections w/o restart)
    3 "make test" (regression tests)
    3 BDB -> no aliases, or flatfile aliases
    4 ability to function with no config file = sensible defaults
    4 command line args override config file, and warnings are issued
    4 non-Linux build
