simta Installation
=================

1.  Requirements

    To build simta, you will need:
	-C compiler

2.  Configuring the source tree

    The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for various
    system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses those values
    to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.  It will also
    create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent definitions.
    Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that you can run in
    the future to recreate the current configuration, and a file `config.log'
    containing compiler output (useful mainly for debugging `configure').

    The autoconf program uses the file `configure.ac' used to create
    `configure'.  You only autoconf if you want to change `configure.ac' or
    regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

    configure options:
	--with-mail_local=/path/to/mail_local/
	    For mail.local support, simta needs the directory of
	    the mail.local binary.  Use this option if mail.local
	    isn't in /usr/lib/ or /usr/sbin/.

	--with-procmail=/path/to/procmail/
	    For procmail support, simta needs the directory of the procmail
	    binary.  Use this option if procmail isn't in /usr/local/bin/ or
	    /usr/local/procmail/bin/.

3.  Building simta

    At this point, simply run the command
	
	$ make
