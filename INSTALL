simta Installation
=================

1.  Requirements

    To build simta, you will need:
	- c compiler
	- local mail delivery program (mail.local or procmail)
	- libssl
	- Berekely db

2.  Configuring the source tree

    The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for various
    system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses those values
    to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.  It will also
    create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent definitions.
    Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that you can run in
    the future to recreate the current configuration, and a file `config.log'
    containing compiler output (useful mainly for debugging `configure').

    The autoconf program uses the file `configure.ac' used to create
    `configure'.  You only autoconf if you want to change `configure.ac' or
    regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

    simta requires a local mail delivery agent.  mail.local and procmail are
    currently supported.  Also see simta.conf for the DEFAULT_LOCAL_MAILER
    option.

    configure options:
	--with-mail_local=/path/to/mail_local/
	    For mail.local support, simta needs the directory of the
	    mail.local binary.  Use this option if mail.local isn't in
	    /usr/lib/ or /usr/sbin/.  The argument "no" disables mail.local
	    support.

	--with-procmail=/path/to/procmail/
	    For procmail support, simta needs the directory of the procmail
	    binary.  Use this option if procmail isn't in /usr/bin/
	    /usr/local/bin/ or /usr/local/procmail/bin/.  The argument "no"
	    disables procmail support.

	--with-ldap=/path/to/ldap/
	    If configure can't find LDAP, use this to give it a path.
	    The argument "no" disables LDAP support.

3.  Building simta

    At this point, simply run the command
	
	$ make
